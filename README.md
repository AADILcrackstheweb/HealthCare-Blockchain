## HealthCare-Blockchain
Developing mathematical models for optimal shard distribution to enhance blockchain scalability in healthcare systems. Exploring the application of threshold cryptography to ensure secure shard management and protect patient data. Optimizing identity management through decentralized control and secure authentication mechanisms.

In modern healthcare systems, managing vast amounts of sensitive patient data securely and efficiently is a significant challenge. Traditional centralized systems are prone to issues like single points of failure, limited scalability, and susceptibility to cyber-attacks. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and transparent nature, presents a promising alternative. However, as healthcare data and transaction volumes grow, blockchains can encounter scalability problems.

This project investigates mathematical models for implementing data sharding in healthcare blockchains to overcome scalability issues. Sharding involves dividing large datasets into smaller, more manageable chunks called "shards," allowing parallel processing and reducing the load on individual nodes. Efficient shard distribution is crucial to ensure smooth access and management of healthcare data while maintaining system performance.

To enhance security and access control over these shards, the project integrates cryptographic threshold techniques. Threshold cryptography ensures that access to a shard is granted only when a predefined number of authorized participants (threshold) agree to unlock the data. This approach fortifies shard security and offers resilient identity management, ensuring that sensitive patient information remains protected from unauthorized access.

The primary goals of the project include:
  => Developing mathematical models for optimal shard distribution to enhance blockchain scalability in healthcare systems.
  => Exploring the application of threshold cryptography to ensure secure shard management and protect patient data.
  => Optimizing identity management through decentralized control and secure authentication mechanisms.
